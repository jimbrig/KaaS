## Highlights

* Use free tools to clear out bloat
* Deactivate unused online accounts
* Get off unwanted mailing lists
* Free up space in your Gmail account
* Clear out browser extensions
* Track down space-wasting documents
* Windows users can use a free utility called WinDirStat;
* Deleting dozens of old accounts individually can be a chore, however. Account Killer is a free service that can help you quit hundreds of popular services with a few clicks. Simply type in the name of a website – or browse the complete list provided – and you’ll see a colour-coded button. For “white-listed” services, Account Killer provides a link directly to the relevant deletion page.
* Remove optional Windows features
* To review and remove installed language packs, open the Start menu and type “lpksetup”.
* Windows 10 also comes with numerous preinstalled Store apps. Clearing these out involves typing in a few commands but it’s easy to do: see here for instructions. For the nuclear option, search the Start menu for “Reset this PC”: this will remove all installed apps and revert your PC to a pristine state, while keeping your personal files safe.
* Prevent programs launching on startup
* Keep your photos in the cloud
* Clean up your feeds
