# Business Process Model and Notation - BPMN

*Source: [Business Process Model & Notation™ (BPMN™) | Object Management Group](https://www.omg.org/bpmn/index.htm)*

The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) specification provides a graphical notation for specifying business processes in a Business Process Diagram. Its goal is to support Business Process Modeling by providing a standard notation that is comprehensible to business users yet represents complex process semantics for technical users.

Business Process Modeling Notation has become the de-facto standard for business processes diagrams. It is intended to be used directly by the stakeholders who design, manage and realize business processes, but at the same time be precise enough to allow BPMN diagrams to be translated into software process components. BPMN has an easy-to-use flowchart-like notation that’s independent of any particular implementation environment.

The primary goal of BPMN is to provide a notation that is readily understandable by all business users, from the business analysts that create the initial drafts of the processes, to the technical developers responsible for implementing the technology that will perform those processes, and finally, to the business people who will manage and monitor those processes. Thus, BPMN creates a standardized bridge for the gap between the business process design and process implementation. Another goal, but no less important, is to ensure that XML® languages designed for the execution of business processes, such as WSBPEL (Web Services Business Process Execution Language), can be visualized with a business-oriented notation.

BPMN is part of the triple crown of process improvement standards: BPMN, CMMN and DMN. Additional resources can be found at [http://www.bpmn.org](http://www.bpmn.org).
