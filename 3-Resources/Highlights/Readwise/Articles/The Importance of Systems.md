* 10 Tools to Help You Implement Systems
  You don’t have to make the next all-encompassing personal productivity system. Take something that’s already been built and apply it to your own life.
  Here are some frameworks and tools you can work from:
  Every day write down your Most Important Tasks
  Setup a Morning Routine
  Put every appointment into your calendar app
  Inbox Zero your email
  Automate your bills
  Plan your meals for the week, and when you’re going to cook them
  Plan your life on different time scales (Daily, Weekly, Quarterly, 25 years)
  Organize your research in a Notetaking App
  Setup a Task Planning system– GTD / ZTD / The Agile Way
* Pick one of these and implement it. Don’t look for the holy grail of systems, pick something simple that works. Your system doesn’t need to be perfect, or cover every edge case. Improve on it later if you need to.
