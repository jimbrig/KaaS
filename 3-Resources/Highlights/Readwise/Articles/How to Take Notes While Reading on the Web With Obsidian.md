## Highlights
- On-page highlighting: This is a great feature. It helps you save time, effort, and energy when taking notes. You can quickly capture important information as you are reading. To do so, open the eloquent window and use the shortcut ‘CTRL+F’ or toggle the ‘highlighter’ icon at the bottom left of the window. Now when you select the text on the webpage, it will temporarily show highlights on the page and copy the text to the extension window.
- Quick capture: If you are reading on the web and a thought or idea pops up in your mind, you can quickly open the eloquent window and store your idea there.
- Snippets and shortcuts: Shortcuts save time. You can use shortcuts and snippets in the eloquent tool for a better note-taking experience. You can see the shortcuts and snippets by clicking on the ‘?’ icon in the top right corner. My most used snippets are ‘URL’ and ‘title’. This helps to capture the source of notes without hassle.
- Compatible with New note-taking applications: This tool was primarily built for Roam research but works pretty well for other tools as well. It supports the use of double brackets [[]], #tags, and nested bullets.
