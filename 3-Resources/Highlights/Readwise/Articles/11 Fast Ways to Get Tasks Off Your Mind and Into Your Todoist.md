## Highlights

* Add a new task from anywhere within the Todoist app by pressing q

* To add a new task to the top of a list, use Shift + A. (Note: These two shortcuts will only work inside a project view.)

* While you’re editing a task, you can change the indentation of the task by pressing Ctrl + Alt + → (Windows legacy app), Alt + Shift + → (Windows 10) or ⌘ + Option + → (Mac). If you indent a task, it becomes the sub-task of the task above it which can be highly useful for breaking down large to-dos into multi-step tasks.
* The desktop apps also have a universal shortcut you can use whenever the Todoist app is open. Just press Shift + Command + A (Mac) or Ctrl + Alt + A (Windows legacy app) to open the Quick Add. (Unfortunately, Windows 10 doesn’t support global shortcuts.)
* Dictate tasks to Todoist
* If you use an iPhone or iPad, all you have to do is ask Siri to add a task — and even set a due date — in Todoist. For example, say “Hey Siri, add a task to start drafting the blog post tomorrow in Todoist”.

* Add tasks from your web browser
* Add tasks by sharing content from any other mobile app
* Add tasks from shortcuts on your phone
* If you have an iPhone, you can add a Todoist widget to the Today tab in your Notification Center. You’ll be able to see your upcoming tasks and add a new one without ever opening the full app.
* Add tasks from your email inbox
* Email is one of the biggest sources of stress in the modern workplace, but Todoist’s plug-ins for Todoist widget to the Today tab in your Notification Center and Outlook can help you keep your digital correspondence wrangled and your inbox clean and organized. Easily add your emails as tasks in Todoist with specific due dates to remind you to respond or follow up. If you tend to check your email on your phone, there are also several 3rd-party app integrations that let you accomplish the same thing.
  Last month, the Todoist team published a full, updated guide on how to reach and stay at Inbox Zero with Todoist.
* Add whole groups of tasks using templates
* Checklists save lives! And stress. And embarrassment. Create your own for recurring projects to make sure nothing falls through the cracks.
* For example, every time I’m planning a new blog post, video or podcast, I always need the same set of tasks. I can’t set these up as recurring tasks because my project schedule fluctuates from week to week.
  Templates come to the rescue. I can simply import a template full of pre-organized tasks each time a video or podcast is coming up. This way, I don’t have to sit down and type out each individual task every single time I need to work on a new project.
  You can create a template from any existing project, or just create a new project, fill it with your required tasks and use that one, instead. Exporting a project as a template and importing it into a new project is a simple process, and you can repeat it as often as necessary.
  Tip: Bookmark the template import link to load a new template with just a click.
* Automatically create tasks using IFTTT or Zapier
* Automatically add your most important emails as tasks in Todoist
* I use Pocket to keep track of my reading. I’ve set up my own integration so that whenever I add a link to my Pocket, a Todoist task is created in my Reading project to remind me to come back to the article. Check out the applet (that’s what IFTTT calls its custom integrations). You can also prevent flooding your Todoist by only adding tasks from Pocket articles that have a specific tag, like mustread.
* Automatically keep track of missed phone calls.
