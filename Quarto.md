# Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a multi-language, [next-generation](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html) version of R Markdown from RStudio, and includes dozens of new features and capabilities while at the same being able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.

In this tutorial we’ll show you how to use RStudio with Quarto. You’ll edit code and markdown in RStudio just as you would with any computational document (e.g. R Markdown), and preview the rendered document in the Viewer tab as you work.

The following is a Quarto document with the extension `.qmd` (on the left) along with its rendered version as HTML (on the right). You could also choose to render it into other formats like PDF, MS Word, etc.
