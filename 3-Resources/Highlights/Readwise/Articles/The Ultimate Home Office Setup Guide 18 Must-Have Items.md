## Highlights

* Make sure that you have access to natural lighting in your office. One of the best ways to do this while also saving space is to put your desk in front of a window. Studies have shown that having exposure to natural light has a wide range of health benefits, including increased productivity.
* there is a strong correlation between daylight exposure in the workplace and your quality of sleep, mental health, visual acuity, productivity, and physical health.
* Not only is a slow Internet connection frustrating, but it will also hinder your productivity. While you wait for attachments to download, files to transfer, or Web pages to load, you could be getting work done.
* When you are shopping for a network router, consider the size of the area where you need coverage and the kinds of devices that will be connected to the router.
* having the option to print and scan at home is a large part of being productive.
* keep your work safe in case your electricity unexpectedly goes out, having a UPS will give you backup power for a limited time.
* You need to make sure that your desk has a large empty area for you to work, or you need to dedicate some space elsewhere. According to a study published in Forbes, about 57% of people think that one's work directly correlates with the tidiness of their office. This means that if your office is messy, your work is likely to be messy as well.
* Good home office setup requires you to keep your workspace and papers organized. One of the best ways to do this is with a file cabinet. If you want a file cabinet that can be used as the legs of your desk, check out this Lorell File Cabinet. Alternatively, if you want something that is small and portable, yet still secure, try the Master Lock Security Steel Box filing system. Finally, this United Solutions file box may be your best bet if you want an easy storage solution
* You will need somewhere to store your supplies, such as pens, paper, sticky notes, ink, and business cards. If you want a simple storage cart with wheels so you can maneuver it around your office, some great options are here and here.
* Stock all of the supplies that you may need in your office and keep track of when you are running low on something.
  You want to have anything available at your fingertips when you need it without having to run out to a store to buy something or wait for supplies to be delivered to your house.
* To eliminate a chaotic look that may lead to feelings of being overwhelmed, hide any cords or other eyesores so you don't have to look at them.
  Here is a good tutorial for hiding your computer cords. Also, consider putting your printer out of the way and hiding your UPS and surge protector.
* Keep your space decluttered.
  What I have found to be one of the most useful of these tips is taking everything out of an area so you have to go item by item and determine what you need and what is trash. To learn more, check out one or two of the 15 books on decluttering that we profile here.
* Separate your work computer from your home computer.
  Don't give yourself the temptation to log onto social media or play a quick computer game while you are in the middle of doing your job. Make sure that the computer you use in your home office is strictly for work.
