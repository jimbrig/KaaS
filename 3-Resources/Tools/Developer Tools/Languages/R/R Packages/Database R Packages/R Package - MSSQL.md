## Overview

MSSQL provides tools that extend the functionality of the [RODBC](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RODBC) package to work with Microsoft SQL Server databases. Makes it easier to browse the database and examine individual tables and views.

MSSQL is implemented as an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package and available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MSSQL).

## Installation

```R
install.packages("MSSQL")
```

## Usage

For a summary of the package:

```r
library(MSSQL)
?MSSQL
```

## Development

- MSSQL is developed openly on [GitHub](https://github.com/gfcm/MSSQL).
- Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/gfcm/MSSQL/issues) there if you encounter problems or have suggestions for future versions.
