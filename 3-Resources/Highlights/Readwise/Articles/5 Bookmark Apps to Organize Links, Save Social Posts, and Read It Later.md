## Highlights

* Memex is one of the most powerful bookmark apps to meet the needs of the modern user, who wants to save links while using a phone, tablet, or computer. Install the extension on your browser and the app on your phone. To bookmark a link on the phone, “share” any link, and from the Share Menu, choose Memex.
* You can save a link and quickly move on, but it’s best to add tags or put it in a particular collection. That will make it easier to find the link later. Memex also includes built-in annotation and notes, which is a handy feature for researchers. Highlight any part of the page that’s important for you, and add notes for later too.
* And yes, you can easily export all previous bookmarks from a browser or another service and import them into Memex.
* Scrapp is a progressive web app (PWA), which means it works offline through browsers like Chrome and Safari on phones and tablets. Once you create an account, you will get a prompt to add it to the home screen. After that, it works just like any phone app, you won’t know the difference. On a desktop browser, you can continue to use it with the extensions.
* Scrapp makes organizing bookmarks as simple as possible and looks good doing it. It uses auto-tags to add labels to any new bookmarks, based on your current labels. So if a link’s URL, title, description, or text have any similar keywords to labels you’ve already created, it will be easier to find it in the future.
* The app also has a “reading list” mode to add links to. Every day, it will send a notification about how many items you have in your reading list, along with a random link from it. The idea is to not let your “read it later” list pile up too much. Plus, you can read links offline by tapping the “read” button on any bookmark.
* Ktab is like a souped-up version of OneTab, one of the best browser tab management extensions. In fact, many OneTab users might want to switch to Ktab after reading this comparison, since you are once again mass-saving links in a session, and clearing up memory.
* PageMarker is a really interesting bookmark manager and organizer because it packages the best features people want from various bookmark apps. Import your current bookmarks into it and get started.
  The app has both tags and folders, letting you organize bookmarks better than ever before. The free version limits you to five tags and folders, while the premium version makes both unlimited. You can also add notes to any bookmark, in markdown. And there’s a robust search engine to quickly find any link.
  PageMarker focuses on actually reading your “read it later” items. It attacks the problem in two ways.
  First, it marks all links in two default folders: Read and Unread. Next, it sends a newsletter of your most recent bookmarks to your inbox, reminding you to read the links rather than letting them saturate.
  In the free version, you can choose which days of the week you want the newsletter, while the paid version even lets you choose the time.
  But PageMarker doesn’t yet have extensions or mobile apps, so it’s more an organizer than your main bookmarking tool. You have to visit the website and manually add links. Once extensions and apps come in, it promises to be one of the best bookmark managers out there.
* Some apps don’t need to do a lot to be just what you’re looking for. Chrome’s bookmark manager is a bit frustrating for power users and lacks a few simple things. Savory tries to fix those limitations as a wrapper for Chrome bookmarks.
  If you have years and years of unorganized bookmarks, you know that Chrome’s bookmark manager doesn’t have the best search engine. Savory is lightning fast at finding links and auto-tags the websites too. You can also add your own tags to make bookmark management easier.
  Chrome also doesn’t let you select multiple links to delete them in bulk. It’s one of the most frustrating limitations, but Savory solves that too.
  A note before you install it: Savory asks you to sign in before it can get to work. It’s unclear why that is, or the privacy implications of it.
