If you don't imitate, I mean, one of the byproducts of that that I can see is you're going slower, like you probably take you longer to do that than it would have to download WordPress. And that goes back, maybe to the complexity right where they're intertwined ([Time 0:10:57](https://www.airr.io/quote/5f37251aa7c7e0ae7199a898))
