## Highlights

* Why Should You have a Weekly Reset System?
  A weekly reset routine -or a ‘GYST (Get your Sh\*t Together) Routine” as Kalyn Nicholson calls it- is important for many reasons.
  Stay on track with your chores
  Stay focused on your Goals
  Pause to understand the situation in a different perspective
  Invest time in yourself to encourage self-love
  Hustle in a systematic manner to get maximum results
* The Reset Routine
  This routine is a basic 4 step routine that makes you feel energized at the end of the day. I usually perform this entire routine on a Sunday to start off my week on a positive note. I am sharing the framework and not the exact routine so that you can create one for yourself as well.
* Catch-up
* Weekly rituals such as laundry, car wash, bathroom cleaning, etc.
  Pending or postponed tasks such as paying the phone bill, getting a new notebook, booking a flight ticket, etc.
  Making calls to loved ones, taking appointments, etc.
