## Highlights

* Create An Online Resource Repository
  Develop a list of valuable resources your online learners can use to expand their knowledge base. For example, articles, video tutorials, and eLearning blogs that align with your learning goals. Alternatively, you can create a microlearning resource repository that features your own eLearning materials. For instance, bite-sized online simulations that explore work-related tasks or compliance-based serious games. The secret is to make eLearning convenient and easily accessible. Keep in mind that your online learners are looking for tools and information they need to solve a problem. An online resource repository gives them the opportunity to continually improve and expand their knowledge on their own time.
* Give Online Learners A List Of Must-Have Tools
  There are a variety of virtual tools that can help your online learners manage their personal knowledge. For example, Project Management online tools that allow them to track eLearning assignments and compile a list of online resources. There are also MOOCs, social media groups, and video sharing sites where they can find valuable information. Provide them with a list of these essential online tools so that they can broaden and curate their own knowledge. Just make sure to update it on a regular basis and remove outdated links.
* Develop Resource Criteria
  As they say, "you can't believe everything you read on the internet". You should emphasize the importance of developing evaluation criteria. This helps your online learners identify relevant and reliable online resources so that they get accurate information. You might even consider a criteria checklist to help them find the right sources. In addition, start a database and invite your online learners to add their own suggestions. For instance, the online sources they've used in the past for specific subject matter.
  Personal Knowledge Management allows your online learners to weed out irrelevant information and commit the key facts to memory. eLearning professionals can even use these Personal Knowledge Management tips when designing their own eLearning courses. You must be able to collect, verify, and organize information in order to optimize the eLearning experience.
