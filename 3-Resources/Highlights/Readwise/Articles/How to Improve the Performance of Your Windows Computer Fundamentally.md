## Highlights

* Speed up a computer: Uninstall unnecessary software
* Either use System Restore or swap out the offending hardware. If you find there are too many software installed in your computer, and some of them you used only once or hardly use, I strongly recommend that you uninstall them, here you can use some professional uninstaller like Wise Program Uninstaller which helps you removed the unwanted ones completely, leaving no residual items behind. If nothing obvious springs to mind there are two things to check.
* Slow PC: Is it your PC or the broadband?
  First, is it your PC or your connection that is slow? If you principally use your PC to email, browse the web and use Facebook it's possible that what is slow is your web connection and not your PC. Also, if you have a laptop take it to a friend's house or into the office where you know the broadband is okay, log on and see how things are. If you have a desktop PC borrow a laptop to do the same check at home (if the laptop slows down the network is the issue). If the web connection is the culprit you can improve things in several ways, but the first one is to complain to your ISP - especially if it has recently got a lot slower.
* Slow PC: is it a virus?
  Much more likely a PC slow-down is caused by a malware infection of some kind. You should of course have a robust internet security package running on your PC or laptop. If you don't, buy and install one today for advice on which one to choose.
  Scan and clean your PC and you should find that things improve. If you have an existing security program it is still worth updating the virus definitions and running a scan, but it is likely that the infection has found a way around your chosen program. You can add a further layer of protection by using a free product to do a further scan and clean up any problems.
