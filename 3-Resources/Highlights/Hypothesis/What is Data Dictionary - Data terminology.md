- Relational database engines enable much more description of data models and provide this information through their data dictionaries. This information is: Data type of column, Default values for columns, Nullability of columns, Table relationships (foreign keys), Uniqueness of column values (primary and unique keys), Data elements descriptions — [Updated on 2022-09-02 16:33:02](https://hyp.is/cPwi5Cr-Ee2VcM8oe0XNVA/dataedo.com/kb/data-glossary/what-is-data-dictionary)  — Group: #Topic/Dev

Those attributes could be: Source, Meaning and purpose, Use, Holds sensitive data, List of values, String formats, UI form label, Owner, — [Updated on 2022-09-02 16:33:06](https://hyp.is/c7qkBir-Ee2XXAvvK_Siag/dataedo.com/kb/data-glossary/what-is-data-dictionary)  — Group: #Topic/Dev
