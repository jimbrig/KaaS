## Highlights

* When I am wrapping up my day, I want to feel a sense of accomplishment that I did what was important, so I don’t need to work extra hours or have ruminating thoughts after work.
* When I am dealing with multiple projects and initiatives, I want to feel I am capturing every single task so I don’t miss any agreement I committed to.
* When I am deciding what to work on, I want to be able to prioritize tasks so I don’t spend too much time on initiatives that are not as important.
* When I am evaluating my work-life balance, I want to feel the productivity system is helping me keep work on check, so I avoid burnout.
* When I am exercising the productivity system, I want to be able to repeat it in a simple and scalable way, so the productivity system works for me and not the other way around.
* The system consists on three sub-systems: modes, tools, and activities.
* There are three possible modes you can engage through this system: signaling, executing, and reflecting.
* Signaling means being aware of potential new tasks or work you need to take ownership of. Whether it’s through meetings, slack threads, or emails, you will need to translate requests into tasks you can track and prioritize
