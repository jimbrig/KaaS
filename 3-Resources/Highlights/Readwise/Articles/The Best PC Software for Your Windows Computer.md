* IObit Uninstaller
  IObit’s Uninstaller sorts all your programs into categories that make it easier to find applications you installed recently, software that takes up a lot of space, or tools you barely ever use. This utility also allows you to quickly get rid of browser toolbars and plugins, and Windows apps.

  Other tools in this category:
  Absolute Uninstaller can fix invalid program entries and supports batch uninstalling.
  Geek Uninstaller is fast and reliable, it comes with a force removal option, and it’s completely portable.
* Note that some installers pack bloatware, useless adware that’s pre-selected to install. It’s the bane of freeware. Thus, Unchecky should be the very first app from this list you should install because it can help you catch checkboxes that commit you to downloading and installing bundled apps you don’t need.
