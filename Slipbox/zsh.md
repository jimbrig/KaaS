# zsh

* zsh is an awesome shell that is nearly identical to [bash](Bash.md) (Bourne-again Shell), but allows for much more customization options.
* [oh-my-zsh](oh-my-zsh.md) - collection of plugins from the zsh community to help manage your shell configuration and speed up workflows.
* [powerlevel10k](powerlevel10k.md) - theme + a necessary [Nerdfont](Nerdfont.md)
* [Ruby](Ruby.md)
