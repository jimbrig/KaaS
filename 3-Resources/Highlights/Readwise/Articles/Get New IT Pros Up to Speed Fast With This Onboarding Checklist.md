## Highlights

* Where to Start With Your Onboarding Plan
* Best Practices for Onboarding
* Incorporate company culture into onboarding: A great employee will have done his or her homework on your company culture, but it's not possible to get the whole picture until he or she actually begins. Experts agree that culture fit is essential to long-term success.
* Identify career paths and demonstrate the skills and traits required to get to the next level: This demonstrates to new employees that they are an important part of the company and that the company is invested in their professional development. Creating a career map will help employees achieve their goals and increase retention within your company.
* Keep the momentum going: "It doesn't all happen on day 1," says Platt. Onboarding doesn't end at the end of the employee's first week or month. The process can take months and feedback from multiple sources is essential. Figure an appropriate amount of time, for example the first week, 30- and 90-day intervals, dependent on the position and check back with the new employee's managers and key stakeholders to find out where and how the new hire can grow professionally and can better meet expectations and goals.
* Send a companywide email: Let everyone in your company know that someone new has arrived and encourage people to introduce themselves and welcome the new employee.
