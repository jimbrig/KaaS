## Highlights

* The best way to transform the information into our knowledge is to interpret something new to us based on what we have learned and share them.
* Interpreting helps us organize and digest information. Therefore it can translate information into our embedded knowledge. And sharing is not only a contribution to the information age but also our motivation to keep outputting better works, which is the reason why I believe that information becomes knowledge via organizing and sharing.
