## Highlights

* “We are kept from our goal not by obstacles but by a clear path to a lesser goal.”
* JOURNALING: Writing about what you’re dealing with is essential. There is so much science to prove this point. Writing about what you’re dealing with allows you to think about it differently. It allows you to see it differently. It turns confusion into words and coherent thoughts, which you can then comprehend and choose what to do with. Writing in your journal every single day is a habit everyone should develop. It helps you become far more self-aware, it helps you reframe experiences, and helps you proactively determine who you want to be.
* TALKING: Aside from journaling, you can and should have people in your life whom you can talk to when you’re going through hard experiences. Whenever I’m overwhelmed, I call my friend Wayne or my mom. They always empathetically listen, encourage me, and by the time I’m done with the phone call, I feel much better. There were many instances during my PhD program when I felt very lonely. I remember pulling all-nighters in strange buildings on campus, studying for some HUGE TEST and wanting to give up. I’d call Wayne and he’d help me through it.
