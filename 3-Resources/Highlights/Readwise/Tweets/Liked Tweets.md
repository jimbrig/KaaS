  <$-- comments in Rmd text, not R code -->
  – missing in cheatsheets and most documentation. 
  date: '`r format(https://t.co/kTTuhNaQYO(), "%Y %B %d")`' 
  – dynamic date, in ISO not USA. 
  20 $^\circ \text(C)$

- @divadnojnarg: (2/4) Earning few JS skills for #RStats #shiny has loads of benefits:
  - Ease debugging (like {htmlwidgets} issues): https://t.co/Eitgrt8aG3.
  - Add new inputs/widgets: https://t.co/W9dR3IB65J
  - Optimize apps: less code from the server (R): https://t.co/ClqdAXok15

- @rstudiotips: PSA: If you're using @RStudio with R 4.2 on Windows, please update to the just-released 2022.02.3. There's an issue with R 4.2 and older @RStudio releases that can empty your R scripts.

- @_ColinFay: This week I gave the last session of a 4 days training on JavaScript for {shiny}. 
  Attendees were seasoned shiny devs, and were amazed by the extent of what you can do with {shiny} once you start mastering JS & understanding how both can work together. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1532251620578410497))
- @_ColinFay: If you stick to R wrappers for JS libs... that's probably 0,1% of what JS can offer. 
  Once you start mastering JS <> {shiny}, "the sky is the limit". Most of the time you can pick a JS lib online and plug it into your app. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1532251622306357248))
- @_ColinFay: Anyway, my number one advice for {shiny} devs is to start learning JS, and all the web technologies. That will def take your apps to the next level. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1532251623648645120))
- @_ColinFay: @TeslaDuBois Unfortunately it's an internal company training, so I can share the material as is, but here are some resources I would suggest :

- @_ColinFay: That's it, it happened. I just coded a tool today that I had already coded 2 years ago, just because I had completely forgotten I had already coded it before. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1535229205209808896))
- @_ColinFay: {shiny} dev pro-tip : learn how to use options("shiny.trace" = TRUE). 
  It can save your life from time to time ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1537412966710140936))
- @_ColinFay: Before I start building one, is there a tool to work with conventional commits in #RStats ?

- @_bcullen: #rstats friends: what are your favorite “lesser known” tips & tricks for using R Markdown? e.g. any feature(s) (big or small) you’ve picked up at some point along your #rmarkdown journey that you now use on a regular basis and wish you knew earlier? 👀👂 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_bcullen/status/1333878752741191680))
- @lisalendway: @_bcullen Likely not lesser known, but adding th code download option to the YAML header. I don’t know why I ever avoided telling my students about that ... now I require it! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lisalendway/status/1333901941253033985))
- @apreshill: @lisalendway @_bcullen Goodness same!!! https://t.co/kgCZIGzHlP ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1333975778040672256))
- @JennyBryan: @_bcullen @juliesquid knitr::knit_exit() for figuring out where the deeply broken thing is by bisecting your Rmd
  https://t.co/u5AQZ6kKcc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1333897294714859521))
- @Shel_Kariuki: @_bcullen Embedding links, especially on the YAML.

- @tjmahr: @_bcullen use project-relative paths with here::here() to avoid any funny business like like report/main.Rmd not being able to see data/data.csv ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tjmahr/status/1334201305062105098))
- @grant_mcdermott: @_bcullen Use pandoc's "fenced div" approach for multi-column environments that work consistently across output types. https://t.co/WmE12wRIXX

- @BeaMilz: @_bcullen knitr::combine_words() 
  I learned this function recently and used quite some times! 
  https://t.co/WENzMmZIS1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BeaMilz/status/1333898698829549578))
- @d_olivaw: @_bcullen @apreshill Use the opts_chunk$set(cache.exta = 1) to invalidate all cache and start fresh. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/d_olivaw/status/1333993099194982400))
- @DrewWalkerr: @_bcullen @juliesquid Just discovered knitr::purl() which converts your rmd to an r script w/same title, super helpful when trying to make your analysis executable by a batch file or the like! 
  https://t.co/2J3bClEeRS ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrewWalkerr/status/1333898571721138180))
- @brshallo: @_bcullen knitr::knit_code() is something I think is pretty nifty. @statsgen has a great post on it: https://t.co/lzxDyhUdJp . I use it indirectly via the `flair` and `flipbookr` packages for communicating code (these use knitr::knit_code() in the background to do their magic). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brshallo/status/1333881802490925056))
- @chendaniely: @_bcullen xaringan::inf_mr(cast_from = "../..")
  to be able to reference figures outside your rmd working directory in xaringan
  pagedown::chrome_print("something.html")
  to print your slides without opening chrome ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chendaniely/status/1339662339965136898))
- @chrisderv: @_bcullen Use the asis knitr engine to conditionally add text content in a document. Very useful for multiple output format or combined with parametrized report to generate different text content from the same Rmd source. 
  https://t.co/qtnBOm5GWc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisderv/status/1334272208085114882))
- @GoldbergData: @_bcullen knit_child() let’s you define a template Rmarkdown and you can loop over arguments and recreate that structure.
  Use case: Imagine you have a document with an intro section and then many subsections that follow a similar structure. knit_child() can automate the smaller sections. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GoldbergData/status/1334241946815004673))
- @mapaulacaldas: @_bcullen You can use the Ctlr + Alt + I to create new code chunks AND to break up big ones into two ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mapaulacaldas/status/1333904571618512898))
- @DagHjermann: @_bcullen Ctrl + Shift + O for showing an overview of your script (shows headers and functions) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DagHjermann/status/1334150313134133251))
- @aggokittu: @_bcullen @rstatstweet Turn sections into tabs with `.tabset` . So users can click on tab titles instead of scrolling. Provides easy organization of parallel content. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/aggokittu/status/1333913351945129987))
- @ericbonucci: @_bcullen Drag and drop formulas from Wikipedia into your R Markdown report!
