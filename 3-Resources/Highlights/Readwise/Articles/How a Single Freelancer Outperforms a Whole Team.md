## Highlights

* Taking a break whenever you like and setting your own schedule is a pipedream in a team environment. In theory, it’s possible, but it’s complicated: other people depend on you to be online at certain times, their work depends on yours and vice-versa, and there are, again, meetings to be had.
* That’s the difference a client feels when they suddenly have a change of heart about a feature or a module of your project. A freelancer is a sports sedan — reliable, responsive, and easy to work with. If a client wants to make a U-turn, all they gotta do is tell you; your tires immediately screech, and you’re headed in the client’s new direction.
