  1. Scalability
     One of the main benefits of cloud computing is scalability. With traditional server hosting, users need to determine the exact hardware that each node of the system would run a particular web application or server. With cloud systems, users can now scale any part of an application more quickly and easily. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1434780891/17134207))
