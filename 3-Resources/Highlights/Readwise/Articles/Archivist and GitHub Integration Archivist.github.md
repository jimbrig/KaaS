## Highlights

* The archivist is an R package for data analysis results management, which helps in managing, sharing, storing, linking and searching for R objects. The archivist package automatically retrieves the object’s meta-data and creates a rich structure that allows for easy management of calculated R objects. It also extends the reproducible research paradigm by creating new ways to retrieve and validate previously calculated objects.
