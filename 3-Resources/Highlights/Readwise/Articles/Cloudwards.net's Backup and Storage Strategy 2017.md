## Highlights

* Hardware
  The HDD replacement I’ve chose are seven 8TB Seagate Archive hard drives, for a total of 56TB of storage. Now, since I’ll have a RAID and a NAS set up as part of my backup strategy I’m not going to use all of that, in fact I will even lose some of it because of the RAID, but it should keep me going for the foreseeable future
* NAS are great for two reasons: on the one hand, since they’re connected to the Internet, you can use one instead of a backup provider and cut out at least one monthly bill. On the other, they serve as a great backup for your backup, so you can rest easy knowing that all the redundancies you’ve set up will keep your data safe whatever may come.
* still need to take care of is that all these different devices and add-ons talk to each other, so I can switch devices yet still work away on the same file like I never moved.
  Sync.com is my regular service for this kind of thing and I see no reason to change since I feel it offers a great price, lightning-fast syncs as well as zero-knowledge security which means that no one will be able to get to my data unless I allow them to. In tandem with Sync.com I’ll also be using pCloud, mainly because it has a great mobile app which I need if I’m traveling and I can’t use my laptop.
