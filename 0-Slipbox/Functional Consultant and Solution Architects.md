# Functional Consultant and Solution Architects

*Source: [Use implementation methodologies for a successful implementation - Learn | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/design-plan-implementation-finance-operations/2-implementation-methodologies)*

## Overview

As a functional consultant for Finance and Operations apps, you need to create Business requirement documents (BRD). A functional consultant works closely with the solution architect. A solution architect is considered an expert and one of the responsibilities of a solution architect is to perform a requirements analysis. It is the solution architect who orchestrates the collaboration with the team to find a solution for the customer’s business problem in the form of workarounds or extensions when requirement can't be met with Finance and Operations apps out-of-the-box features.

## Why methodologies are important?

A correct sequence of tasks, and ensuring all required resources and artifacts are managed properly throughout the lifecycle of Finance and Operations apps, is essential for a successful implementation.

Any successful implementation usually consists of five major phases:

-   Analysis
-   Design and develop
-   Test
-   Deploy
-   Operate

In the next units, you’ll look at a summary of tasks in the implementation methodology. This will help you understand the overall phases of implementation. By collaborating with other project team members, you can better fulfill your duty and exceed the expectation of the customer to have a successful go-live.

Regardless of deployment topology, either on the cloud or on-premises, the methodologies are very similar. Even though a cloud implementation is a much more reasonable solution for a better total cost of ownership (TCO), some businesses might still choose to use on-premises.
