## Highlights

* The beginning of a new year is an opportunity to reinvent, renew and revamp our approach toward living our best life. It’s great for planning and refocusing our priorities. If you ended 2020 in the doldrums of despair and disappointment, please know you now have the ability to write a masterpiece this year.
* The surest way to get there is by creating an inspirational routine that empowers and encourages you to create habits and plan your success for each day and week. It all starts with inspirational ideas.
* “You need to learn how to select your thoughts just the same way you select your clothes every day. This is a power you can cultivate. If you want to control things in your life so bad, work on the mind. That’s the only thing you should be trying to control.” — Elizabeth Gilbert
* In this vein, I urge you to develop an inspirational routine each morning. It may come through the power of meditation, prayer, genuine heartfelt interaction with those that you love or from your favorite song. It could be a video that plays back the piano recital you played to perfection that brought the house down.
* “Great are they who see that spiritual is stronger than any material force — that thoughts rule the world.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson
* Make your routine an every day thing. As I’ve built a successful entrepreneurial career from scratch, I’ve learned that planning and daily routine are what power success. Planning reinforces what you’re trying to achieve. Planning reassure you that all of your progress toward self-actualization, as well as greater harmony and rhythm in living, is worth the pain and occasional doubts.
* Dedicate 10 minutes of contemplation time, ideally, at the beginning of each day. This sets the tone for your day and gets you feeling inspired.
* Use this time alone in solitude, in a quiet place. Focus your thoughts on positive, inspiring thoughts such as: romantic love, excitement for a new opportunity, music, friendship and envisioning yourself attaining success or fame. There’s tremendous power that comes through dreaming and seeing yourself standing “in the winner’s circle.”
* Get these positive thoughts going and keep them going. Write down these thoughts that come to mind. Keep referring back to them throughout your work day or school day. Think of them when you’re out in the social world, during moments of difficulty or times of joy. Look at them again before you go to bed at night and reset your mind. Then rest and get read for the new day with excitement, anticipation and a clear mind for fresh, new thoughts.
