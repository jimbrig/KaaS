## Highlights

* BE is founded upon a value-, integration- and information-driven strategy — one that is applicable to any industry, or any business model. The foundation is a configured representation of the managed environment, across all its “participants”, contributory and otherwise. This is a combination of what most organisations undertake plus their individual “uniqueness” — both now and in the future. This provides a contextual base for collating all business-related fact; linking strategy to operations; and integrating the traditional transactional environments — as the basis of more objective decision-making and contextually “correct” operations.
* 
  1. Business strategy, business principles and the logic which supports/enhances operations
* 
  2. Integrated strategic and operational planning; the marshalling and management of its activities and the wide range of capabilities they employ; plus, all relationships with the “collective of participants” involved and the outside world
* 
  3. Continuous measurement and appraisal of what occurs, and the value-to-the-business/customer/society generated or expended — as the basis of more objective planning, operations and change, based upon up-to-date, provenanced and managed contextual fact, tailored to your interpretation of your business and its environment
