## What is RDS?

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.

## Overview of Amazon RDS

Why do you want to run a relational database in the AWS Cloud? Because AWS takes over many of the difficult and tedious management tasks of a relational database.
