## Highlights
* I am, and ever will be, a white-socks, pocket-protector, nerdy engineer—born under the second law of thermodynamics, steeped in the steam tables, in love with free-body diagrams, transformed by Laplace, and propelled by compressible flow.

* The Greek letter eta, in lower case, often shows up in engineering documents. Engineers pay a good bit of attention to improving eta because it is a symbol for efficiency—doing an equivalent or better job with less weight, less power, less time, less cost. The entire existence of engineers is dedicated to doing things better and more efficiently.
* When knowledge, facts, or solutions are sought, there are a number of techniques available from which to select. These techniques can be ranked according to their effectiveness, from the most certain to the most uncertain.
* Engineering is a profession which leaves its imprint on our society in countless ways. We all intuitively understand the term “quality of life,” but we have difficulty in attempting to define it.
* Truly, it has been a magical century.
