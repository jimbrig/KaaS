## Highlights

* Solution
  In my experience, the solution I’ve outlined below offers me an excellent approach for long term reproducibility and code stability:
  Lock down your R package versions using MRAN snapshots
  Lock down your working environment using a Docker image
  Do all your development within Docker containers
  Accompany all projects with a Docker image
  This has worked so well that I haven’t bothered using R/Rstudio on my local machine in well over half a year now. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355675192/14404460))
