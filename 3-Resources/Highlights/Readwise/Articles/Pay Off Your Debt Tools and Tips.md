* Consider a personal loan to consolidate several debts into one at a lower interest rate. For people with good or excellent credit, these loans often have lower interest rates than credit cards.
  You might be able to get a personal loan to consolidate several debts into one at a lower interest rate. These loans often have lower interest rates than credit cards.
  If you can’t qualify for a personal loan at the interest rate you’d like — or if you just need some outside structure to be successful — consider a debt management plan. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1432475639/17062508))
* 5 tips for paying off debt
