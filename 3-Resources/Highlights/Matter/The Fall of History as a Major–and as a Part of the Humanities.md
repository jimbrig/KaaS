## Highlights
* I struggle to label the first group with one word—I waffle between “the modelers,” “the data heads,” and “the social scientists.” This group is comprised of psychologists, cognitive scientists, computer scientists, data scientists, statisticians, economists, quantitative sociologists, geographers, anybody who uses the word “computational” in front of their job description, and anybody whose main method of public engagement is a dynamic data visualization. Data is the watchword of these folks, empiricism their vocation, science their title.
