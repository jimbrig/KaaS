## Highlights

* When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do?
  My best friend put a little quote in my birthday card a few years ago: 
  “When makes a river so restful to people is that it doesn't have any doubt- it is sure to get where it is going, and it doesn't want to go anywhere else." – Hal Bovle 
  There is so much going on in a day, actions and distractions, it's easy to get caught up and lose your vision. This quote brings me right back to where I want to be. It keeps me grounded. (Page 184)

* If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it say and why?
  Simple one for me to answer: 
  “Storms make us stronger." 
  If I had one mes for young people embarking on life, it would be this. Don't shy away from the hard times. Tackle them head-on, move toward the path less trodden, riddled with obstacles, because most other people run at the first sign of battle, The storms give us a chance to define ourselves, to distinguish ourselves, and we always emerge from them stronger.

  Greg: 
  First, I yell "FUCK!" as loud as I can! Then, I compartmentalize and DIN and DIP ("do it now" and "do it proper"). (Page 285)
