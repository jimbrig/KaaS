# Data Pipelines

## What is a Data Pipeline?

"A arbitrarily complex chain of processes that manipulate data where the output data of one process becomes the input to the next."

"A process to take raw data and transform in a way that usable by the entire organization."

"Data Processing Pipeline is a collection of instructions to read, transform or write data that is designed to be executed by a data processing engine."

A data pipeline can have these characteristics: 

* 1 or more data inputs.
* 1 or more data outputs.
* Optional filtering.
* Optional transformation, including schema changes (adding or removing fields) and transforming the format.
* Optional aggregation, including group by, joins, and statistics.
* Other robustness features.
