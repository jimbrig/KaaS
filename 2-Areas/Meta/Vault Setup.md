# Vault Setup

## Note Types

- [[Daily-Notes/_README|Daily Notes]]: Daily notes for journaling and reflection
- [[2-Areas/Meta/_README|Meta]]: Houses meta-information about the vault itself and its setup (i.e. this note is a meta note!)
- [[2-Areas/MOCs/_README|Maps of Content (MOCs)]]: Index notes that form the backbone structure of the vault around common topics.
- [[1-Projects/_README|Projects]]: Project based notes split between Personal and Professional.
- [[Reference/_README|Reference]]: General Reference notes (i.e. Citations, Sources, and Work Reference Materials)
- [[3-Resources/_README|Resources]]: Resourceful notes such as embedded websites, highlights from Readwise, etc.
- [[0-Slipbox/_README|Slipbox]]: The main folder of the vault. Houses all of my notes in a Zettelkasten manner. 
	- [[Fleeting Notes]]: Notes that are pre-mature and ephemeral
	- [[Literary Notes]]: Notes representing external ideas and knowledge that I have captured.
	- [[Permanent Notes]]: Notes that are considered *Evergreen*, i.e., notes that I have curated and formulated
	- [[Concept Notes]]: Notes that are just describing or defining a concept or idea.
	- [[Structural Notes]]: Structure notes are notes that organize other notes
	- [[Source Notes]]: similar to Literary Notes, but denote a structure specific to a certain source type (i.e. podcast, book, video, course, etc.)
- [[Templates/_README|Templates]]: Templates for various types of notes and situations
