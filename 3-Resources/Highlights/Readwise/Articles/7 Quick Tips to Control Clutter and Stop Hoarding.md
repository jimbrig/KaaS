## Highlights

* Start Slow
* This may lead to strong feelings of regret and anxiety; rather, go through one small space or collection each week.
* Handle Objects Only Once
  Curb the tendency to put something aside "for now." Fans of David Allen's "Getting Things Done" system have been applying this trick to their email for years. Take the time to make a decision about an item in the present so you don't have to handle it, again and again, each time you decide to get organized.
* Put It in a Box
  If you cannot decide to toss or keep an item, put it in a box for 6 months. If you don't open the box before then, you can let it go without regret. This is a great idea for people who hoard items like magazines, travel toiletries, and newspaper clippings
* Toss Unused Items
* Once you start tossing the items you never use, it will be easier to keep clutter from creeping up. You'll be used to having a more minimalist approach.
