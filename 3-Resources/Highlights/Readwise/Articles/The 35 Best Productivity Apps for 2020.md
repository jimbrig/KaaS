## Highlights

* Woven – For a combined calendar and scheduling app
* it’s in the integrated scheduling features where Woven really shines. The app lets you create scheduling links to share so others can grab a time slot on your calendar based on your specified availability. You can also create group polls to find a time slot that works for the most people, then simply click to add it to everyone’s calendars. (The people you share links and group polls with don’t have to be Woven users themselves.) There’s no app out there that packs this much scheduling power directly inside a beautifully designed calendar app in it’s own right.
* Kindle for iPhone/Android – For reading books instead of browsing social media
* Audible – For listening to books
* Libby – For reading & listening to library books (for free!)
* Feedly – For curating your own newsfeed
* PocketCasts – For staying up-to-date on all your podcasts
* Notion – For creating your own personal wiki
* Doist’s Growth Marketer, Hugo, relies on Notion to keep his thoughts, ideas, and projects organized:
  Notion is my main place for thinking with words, jotting down ideas, consolidating my learnings, and keeping all of that quite organized. I also use it for personal projects like: what I need to think about for my sister’s wedding ceremony, tracking my Doist perks, or keeping an overview of revenues/expenses for finances (with tables), books I read (with a gallery), and sometimes bookmarking things I’ve read for later reference.
